+Drupal 7.40, 2015-10-14
+-----------------------
+- Made Drupal's code for parsing .info files run much faster and use much less
+  memory.
+- Prevented drupal_http_request() from returning an error when it receives a
+  201 through 206 HTTP status code.
+- Added support for autoloading traits via the registry on sites running PHP
+  5.4 or higher.
+- Allowed the user-picture.tpl.php theme template to have HTML classes besides
+  the default "user-picture" class printed in it (markup change).
+- Fixed the URL text filter to convert e-mail addresses with plus signs into
+  mailto: links.
+- Added alternate text to file icons displayed by the File module, to improve
+  accessibility (string change, and minor API addition to theme_file_icon()).
+- Changed one-time login link failure messages to be displayed as errors or
+  warnings as appropriate, rather than as regular status messages (minor UI
+  change and data structure change).
+- Changed the default settings.php configuration to exclude private files from
+  the "404_fast_paths" behavior.
+- Changed the page that displays filter tips for a particular text format, for
+  example filter/tips/full_html, to return "page not found" or "access denied"
+  if the format does not exist or the user does not have access to it. This
+  change adds a new menu item to the Filter module's hook_menu() entry (minor
+  data structure change).
+- Added a new hook, hook_block_cid_parts_alter(), to allow modules to alter the
+  cache keys used for caching a particular block.
+- Made drupal_set_message() display and return messages when "0" is passed in
+  as the message to set.
+- Fixed non-functional "Files displayed by default" setting on file fields.
+- The "worker callback" provided in hook_cron_queue_info() and the "finished"
+  callback specified during batch processing can now be any PHP callable
+  instead of just functions.
+- Prevented drupal_set_time_limit() from decreasing the time limit in the case
+  where the PHP maximum execution time is already unlimited.
+- Changed the default thousand marker for numeric fields from a space ("1 000")
+  to nothing ("1000") (minor UI change: https://www.drupal.org/node/1388376).
+- Prevented malformed theme .info files (without a "name" key) from causing
+  exceptions during menu rebuilds. If an .info file without a "name" key is
+  found in a module or theme directory, Drupal will now use the module or
+  theme's machine name as the display name instead.
+- Made the format column in the {date_format_locale} database table
+  case-sensitive, to match the equivalent column in the {date_formats} table.
+- Fixed a bug in the Statistics module that caused JavaScript files attached to
+  a node while it is being viewed to be omitted from the page.
+- Added an optional 'project:' prefix that can be added to dependencies in a
+  module's .info file to indicate which project the dependency resides in (API
+  addition: https://www.drupal.org/node/2299747).
+- Fixed various bugs that occurred after hooks were invoked early in the Drupal
+  bootstrap and that caused module_implements() and drupal_alter() to cache an
+  incomplete set of hook implementations for later use.
+- Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to "nosniff" when possible, to prevent
+  certain web browsers from picking an unsafe MIME type.
+- Prevented the database API from executing multiple queries at once on MySQL,
+  if the site's PHP version is new enough to do so. This is a secondary defense
+  against SQL injection (API change: https://www.drupal.org/node/2463973).
+- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused the upgrade
+  to fail when there were multiple file records pointing to the same file.
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.39, 2015-08-19
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2015-003.
+
+Drupal 7.38, 2015-06-17
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2015-002.
+
+Drupal 7.37, 2015-05-07
+-----------------------
+- Fixed a regression in Drupal 7.36 which caused certain kinds of content types
+  to become disabled if they were defined by a no-longer-enabled module.
+- Removed a confusing description regarding automatic time zone detection from
+  the user account form (minor UI and data structure change).
+- Allowed custom HTML tags with a dash in the name to pass through filter_xss()
+  when specified in the list of allowed tags.
+- Allowed hook_field_schema() implementations to specify indexes for fields
+  based on a fixed-length column prefix (rather than the entire column), as was
+  already allowed in hook_schema() implementations.
+- Fixed PDO exceptions on PostgreSQL when accessing invalid entity URLs.
+- Added a sites/all/libraries folder to the codebase, with instructions for
+  using it.
+- Added a description to the "Administer text formats and filters" permission
+  on the Permissions page (string change).
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.36, 2015-04-01
+-----------------------
+- Added a 'file_public_schema' variable which allows modules that define
+  publicly-accessible streams in hook_stream_wrappers() to bypass file download
+  access checks when processing managed file upload fields.
+- Fixed a bug that caused database query tags not to be added to search-related
+  database queries under many circumstances, and which prevented the
+  corresponding hook_query_TAG_alter() implementations from being called.
+- Fixed the "for" attribute on managed file upload field labels to improve
+  accessibility (minor markup change).
+- Added a 'javascript_always_use_jquery' variable which can be set to FALSE by
+  sites that may not need jQuery loaded on all pages, and a 'requires_jquery'
+  option to drupal_add_js() which modules can set to FALSE when adding
+  JavaScript files that have no dependency on jQuery (API addition:
+  https://www.drupal.org/node/2462717).
+- Fixed incorrect foreign keys in the User module's role_permission and
+  users_roles database tables.
+- Changed permission descriptions throughout Drupal core to consistently link
+  to relevant administrative pages, regardless of whether the user viewing the
+  Permissions page can view the page being linked to (minor UI change).
+- Fixed the drupal_add_region_content() function so that it actually adds
+  content to the page.
+- Added an 'image_suppress_itok_output' variable to allow sites already using
+  the existing 'image_allow_insecure_derivatives' variable to also prevent
+  security tokens from appearing in image derivative URLs.
+- Fixed double-escaping of theme names in the Block module administrative
+  interface (minor string change).
+- Added basic support for Xdebug when running automated tests.
+- Fixed a bug which caused previewing a node to remove elements from the node
+  being edited. With this fix, calling node_preview() will no longer modify the
+  passed-in node object (minor API change).
+- Added a user_has_role() function to check whether a user has a particular
+  role (API addition: https://www.drupal.org/node/2462411).
+- Fixed installation failures when an opcode cache is enabled.
+- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused private
+  files to be inaccessible.
+- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused user
+  pictures to be lost.
+- Fixed missing language code in hook_field_attach_view_alter() when it is
+  invoked from field_view_field().
+- Stopped sending ETag and Last-Modified headers for uncached page requests,
+  since they break caching for certain Varnish and Nginx configurations.
+- Changed the Simpletest module to allow PSR-4 test classes to be used in
+  Drupal 7.
+- Fixed a fatal error that occurred when using the Comment module's "Unpublish
+  comment containing keyword(s)" action.
+- Changed the "lang" attribute on language links to "xml:lang" so it validates
+  as XHTML (minor markup change).
+- Prevented the form API from allowing arrays to be submitted for various form
+  elements, such as textfields, textareas, and password fields (API change:
+  https://www.drupal.org/node/2462723).
+- Fixed a bug in the Contact module which caused the global user object to have
+  the incorrect name and e-mail address during the remainder of the page
+  request after the contact form is submitted.
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.35, 2015-03-18
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2015-001.
+
+Drupal 7.34, 2014-11-19
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2014-006.
+
+Drupal 7.33, 2014-11-07
+-----------------------
+- Began storing the file modification time of each module and theme in the
+  {system} database table so that contributed modules can use it to identify
+  recently changed modules and themes (minor data structure change to the
+  return value of system_get_info() and other related functions).
+- Added a "Did you mean?" feature to the run-tests.sh script for running
+  automated tests from the command line, to help developers who are attempting
+  to run a particular test class or group.
+- Changed the date format used in various HTTP headers output by Drupal core
+  from RFC 1123 format to RFC 7231 format.
+- Added a "block_cache_bypass_node_grants" variable to allow sites which have
+  node access modules enabled to use the block cache if desired (API addition).
+- Made image derivative generation HTTP requests return a 404 error (rather
+  than a 500 error) when the source image does not exist.
+- Fixed a bug which caused user pictures to be removed from the user object
+  after saving, and resulted in data loss if the user account was subsequently
+  re-saved.
+- Fixed a bug in which field_has_data() did not return TRUE for fields that
+  only had data in older entity revisions, leading to loss of the field's data
+  when the field configuration was edited.
+- Fixed a bug which caused the Ajax progress throbber to appear misaligned in
+  many situatons (minor styling change).
+- Prevented the Bartik theme from lower-casing the "Permalink" link on
+  comments, for improved multilingual support (minor UI change).
+- Added a "preferred_menu_links" tag to the database query that is used by
+  menu_link_get_preferred() to find the preferred menu link for a given path,
+  to make it easier to alter.
+- Increased the maximum allowed length of block titles to 255 characters
+  (database schema change to the {block} table).
+- Removed the Field module's field_modules_uninstalled() function, since it did
+  not do anything when it was invoked.
+- Added a "theme_hook_original" variable to templates and theme functions and
+  an optional sitewide theme debug mode, to provide contextual information in
+  the page's HTML to theme developers. The theme debug mode is based on the one
+  used with Twig in Drupal 8 and can be accessed by setting the "theme_debug"
+  variable to TRUE (API addition).
+- Added an entity_view_mode_prepare() API function to allow entity-defining
+  modules to properly invoke hook_entity_view_mode_alter(), and used it
+  throughout Drupal core to fix bugs with the invocation of that hook (API
+  change: https://www.drupal.org/node/2369141).
+- Security improvement: Made the database API's orderBy() method sanitize the
+  sort direction ("ASC" or "DESC") for queries built with db_select(), so that
+  calling code does not have to.
+- Changed the RDF module to consistently output RDF metadata for nodes and
+  comments near where the node is rendered in the HTML (minor markup and data
+  structure change).
+- Added an HTML class to RDFa metatags throughout Drupal to prevent them from
+  accidentally affecting the site appearance (minor markup change).
+- Fixed a bug in the Unicode requirements check which prevented installing
+  Drupal on PHP 5.6.
+- Fixed a bug which caused drupal_get_bootstrap_phase() to abort the bootstrap
+  when called early in the page request.
+- Renamed the "Search result" view mode to "Search result highlighting input"
+  to better reflect how it is used (UI change).
+- Improved database queries generated by EntityFieldQuery in the case where
+  delta or language condition groups are used, to reduce the number of INNER
+  JOINs (this is a minor data structure change affecting code which implements
+  hook_query_alter() on these queries).
+- Removed special-case behavior for file uploads which allowed user #1 to
+  bypass maximum file size and user quota limits.
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.32, 2014-10-15
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (SQL injection). See SA-CORE-2014-005.
+
+Drupal 7.31, 2014-08-06
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (denial of service). See SA-CORE-2014-004.
+
+Drupal 7.30, 2014-07-24
+-----------------------
+- Fixed a regression introduced in Drupal 7.29 that caused files or images
+  attached to taxonomy terms to be deleted when the taxonomy term was edited
+  and resaved (and other related bugs with contributed and custom modules).
+- Added a warning on the permissions page to recommend restricting access to
+  the "View site reports" permission to trusted administrators. See
+  DRUPAL-PSA-2014-002.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.29, 2014-07-16
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2014-003.
+
+Drupal 7.28, 2014-05-08
+-----------------------
+- Fixed a regression introduced in Drupal 7.27 that caused JavaScript to break
+  on older browsers (such as Internet Explorer 8 and earlier) when Ajax was
+  used.
+- Increased the timeout used by the Update Manager module when it fetches data
+  from drupal.org (from 5 seconds to 30 seconds), to work around a problem
+  which causes incomplete information about security updates to be presented to
+  site administrators. This fix may lead to a performance slowdown on the
+  Update Manager administration pages, when installing Drupal distributions,
+  and (for sites that use the automated cron feature) on occasional page loads
+  by site visitors.
+- Fixed the behavior of the token system's "[node:summary]" token when the body
+  field does not have a manual summary.
+- Changed the behavior of db_query_temporary() so that it works on SELECT
+  queries even when they have leading comments/whitespace. A side effect of
+  this fix is that db_query_temporary() will now fail with an error if it is
+  ever used on non-SELECT queries.
+- Added a "node_admin_filter" tag to the database query used to build the list
+  of nodes on the content administration page, to make it easier to alter.
+- Made the cron queue system log any exceptions that are thrown while an item
+  in the queue is being processed, rather than stopping the entire PHP request.
+- Improved screen reader support by adding an aria-live HTML attribute to file
+  upload fields when there is an error uploading the file (minor markup
+  change).
+- Made the pager on the Tracker module listing pages show the same number of
+  items as other pagers throughout Drupal core (minor UI change).
+- Fixed a bug which caused caches not to be properly cleared when a file entity
+  was saved or deleted.
+- Added several missing countries to the default list returned by
+  country_get_list() (string change).
+- Replaced the term "weight" with "influence" in the content ranking settings
+  for search, and added help text for administrators (string change).
+- Fixed untranslatable text strings in the administrative interface for the
+  "Crop" effect provided by the Image module (minor string change).
+- Fixed a bug in the Taxonomy module update function introduced in Drupal 7.26
+  that caused memory and CPU problems on sites with very large numbers of
+  unpublished nodes.
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.27, 2014-04-16
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (information disclosure). See SA-CORE-2014-002.
+
+Drupal 7.26, 2014-01-15
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2014-001.
+
+Drupal 7.25, 2014-01-02
+-----------------------
+- Fixed a bug in node_save() which prevented the saved node from being updated
+  in hook_node_insert() and other similar hooks.
+- Added a meta tag to install.php to prevent it from being indexed by search
+  engines even when Drupal is installed in a subfolder (minor markup change).
+- Fixed a bug in the database API that caused frequent deadlock errors when
+  running merge queries on some servers.
+- Performance improvement: Prevented block rehashing from writing blocks to the
+  database on every cache clear and cron run when the blocks have not changed.
+  This fix results in an extra 'saved' key which is added and set to TRUE for
+  each block returned by _block_rehash() that actually is saved to the database
+  (data structure change).
+- Added an optional 'skip on cron' parameter to hook_cron_queue_info() to allow
+  queues to avoid being automatically processed on cron runs (API addition).
+- Fixed a bug which caused hook_block_view_MODULE_DELTA_alter() to never be
+  invoked if the block delta had a hyphen in it. To implement the hook when the
+  block delta has a hyphen, modules should now replace hyphens with underscores
+  when constructing the function name for the hook implementation.
+- Fixed a bug which caused cached pages to sometimes be sent to the browser
+  with incorrect compression. The fix adds a new 'page_compressed' key to the
+  $cache->data array returned by drupal_page_get_cache() (minor data structure
+  change).
+- Fixed broken tests on PHP 5.5.
+- Made the File and Image modules more robust when saving entities that have
+  deleted files attached. The code in file_field_presave() will now remove the
+  record of the deleted file from the entity before saving (minor data
+  structure change).
+- Standardized menu callback functions throughout Drupal core to return
+  MENU_NOT_FOUND and MENU_ACCESS_DENIED rather than printing their own "page
+  not found" or "access denied" pages (minor API change in the return value of
+  these functions under some circumstances).
+- Fixed a bug in which caches were not properly cleared when a node was deleted
+  via the administrative interface.
+- Changed the Bartik theme to render content contained in <pre>, <code> and
+  similar tags in a larger font size, so it is easier to read.
+- Fixed a bug in the Search module that caused exceptions to be thrown during
+  searches if the server was not configured to represent decimal points as a
+  period.
+- Fixed a regression in the Image module that made image_style_url() not work
+  when a relative path (rather than a complete file URI) was passed to it.
+- Added an optional feature to the Statistics module to allow node views to be
+  tracked by Ajax requests rather than during the server-side generation of the
+  page. This allows the node counter to work on sites that use external page
+  caches (string change and new administrative option:
+  https://drupal.org/node/2164069).
+- Added a link to the drupal.org documentation page for cron to the Cron
+  settings page (string change).
+- Added a 'drupal_anonymous_user_object' variable to allow the anonymous user
+  object returned by drupal_anonymous_user() to be overridden with a classed
+  object (API addition).
+- Changed the database API to allow inserts based on a SELECT * query to work
+  correctly.
+- Changed the database schema of the {file_managed} table to allow Drupal to
+  manage files larger than 4 GB.
+- Changed the File module's hook_field_load() implementation to prevent file
+  entity properties which have the same name as file or image field properties
+  from overwriting the field properties (minor API change).
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.24, 2013-11-20
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities), see SA-CORE-2013-003.
+
+Drupal 7.23, 2013-08-07
+-----------------------
+- Fixed a fatal error on PostgreSQL databases when updating the Taxonomy module
+  from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7.
+- Fixed the default ordering of CSS files for sites using right-to-left
+  languages, to consistently place the right-to-left override file immediately
+  after the CSS it is overriding (API change: https://drupal.org/node/2058463).
+- Added a drupal_check_memory_limit() API function to allow the memory limit to
+  be checked consistently (API addition).
+- Changed the default web.config file for IIS servers to allow favicon.ico
+  files which are present in the filesystem to be accessed.
+- Fixed inconsistent support for the 'tel' protocol in Drupal's URL filtering
+  functions.
+- Performance improvement: Allowed all hooks to be included in the
+  module_implements() cache, even those that are only invoked on HTTP POST
+  requests.
+- Made the database system replace truncate queries with delete queries when
+  inside a transaction, to fix issues with PostgreSQL and other databases.
+- Fixed a bug which caused nested contextual links to display improperly.
+- Fixed a bug which prevented cached image derivatives from being flushed for
+  private files and other non-default file schemes.
+- Fixed drupal_render() to always return an empty string when there is no
+  output, rather than sometimes returning NULL (minor API change).
+- Added protection to cache_clear_all() to ensure that non-cache tables cannot
+  be truncated (API addition: a new isValidBin() method has been added to the
+  default database cache implementation).
+- Changed the default .htaccess file to support HTTP authorization in CGI
+  environments.
+- Changed the password reset form to pre-fill the username when requested via a
+  URL query parameter, and used this in the error message that appears after a
+  failed login attempt (minor data structure and behavior change).
+- Fixed broken support for foreign keys in the field API.
+- Fixed "No active batch" error when a user cancels their own account.
+- Added a description to the "access content overview" permission on the
+  permissions page (string change).
+- Added a drupal_array_diff_assoc_recursive() function to allow associative
+  arrays to be compared recursively (API addition).
+- Added human-readable labels to image styles, in addition to the existing
+  machine-readable name (API change: https://drupal.org/node/2058503).
+- Moved the drupal_get_hash_salt() function to bootstrap.inc and used it in
+  additional places in the code, for added security in the case where there is
+  no hash salt in settings.php.
+- Fixed a regression in Drupal 7.22 that caused internal server errors for
+  sites running on very old Apache 1.x web servers.
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.

 /**
- * Parses a system URL string into an associative array suitable for url().

  *
- * This function should only be used for URLs that have been generated by the
- * system, such as via url(). It should not be used for URLs that come from
- * external sources, or URLs that link to external resources.
+ * This function splits both internal paths like @code node?b=c#d @endcode and
+ * external URLs like @code https://example.com/a?b=c#d @endcode into their
+ * component parts. See
+ * @link http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3 RFC 3986 @endlink for an
+ * explanation of what the component parts are.
  *
- * The returned array contains a 'path' that may be passed separately to url().
- * For example:
- * @code
- *   $options = drupal_parse_url($_GET['destination']);
- *   $my_url = url($options['path'], $options);
- *   $my_link = l('Example link', $options['path'], $options);
- * @endcode
- *
- * This is required, because url() does not support relative URLs containing a
- * query string or fragment in its $path argument. Instead, any query string
- * needs to be parsed into an associative query parameter array in
- * $options['query'] and the fragment into $options['fragment'].
+ * Note that, unlike the RFC, when passed an external URL, this function
+ * groups the scheme, authority, and path together into the path component.
  *
- * @param $url
- *   The URL string to parse, f.e. $_GET['destination'].
+ * @param string $url
+ *   The internal path or external URL string to parse.
  *

- *   An associative array containing the keys:
- *   - 'path': The path of the URL. If the given $url is external, this includes
- *     the scheme and host.

-/**
- * Provide online user help.
- *
- * By implementing hook_help(), a module can make documentation available to
- * the user for the module as a whole, or for specific paths.  Help for
- * developers should usually be provided via function header comments in the
- * code, or in special API example files.
- *
- * For a detailed usage example, see page_example.module.
- *
- * @param $path
- *   The router menu path, as defined in hook_menu(), for the help that is
- *   being requested; e.g., 'admin/people' or 'user/register'.  If the router
- *   path includes a wildcard, then this will appear in $path as %, even if it
- *   is a named %autoloader wildcard in the hook_menu() implementation; for
- *   example, node pages would have $path equal to 'node/%' or 'node/%/view'.
- *   To provide a help page for a whole module with a listing on admin/help,
- *   your hook implementation should match a path with a special descriptor
- *   after a "#" sign:
- *     'admin/help#modulename'
- *       The main module help text, displayed on the admin/help/modulename
- *       page and linked to from the admin/help page.
- * @param $arg
- *   An array that corresponds to the return value of the arg() function, for
- *   modules that want to provide help that is specific to certain values
- *   of wildcards in $path. For example, you could provide help for the path
- *   'user/1' by looking for the path 'user/%' and $arg[1] == '1'. This given
- *   array should always be used rather than directly invoking arg(), because
- *   your hook implementation may be called for other purposes besides building
- *   the current page's help. Note that depending on which module is invoking
- *   hook_help, $arg may contain only empty strings. Regardless, $arg[0] to
- *   $arg[11] will always be set.
- *
- * @return
- *   A localized string containing the help text.

+ *   array passed to batch_set().
+ * @param $context
+ *   The batch context array, passed by reference. This contains the following
+ *   properties:
+ *   - 'finished': A float number between 0 and 1 informing the processing
+ *     engine of the completion level for the operation. 1 (or no value
+ *     explicitly set) means the operation is finished: the operation will not
+ *     be called again, and execution passes to the next operation or the
+ *     callback_batch_finished() implementation. Any other value causes this
+ *     operation to be called again; however it should be noted that the value
+ *     set here does not persist between executions of this callback: each time
+ *     it is set to 1 by default by the batch system.
+ *   - 'sandbox': This may be used by operations to persist data between
+ *     successive calls to the current operation. Any values set in
+ *     $context['sandbox'] will be there the next time this function is called
+ *     for the current operation. For example, an operation may wish to store a
+ *     pointer in a file or an offset for a large query. The 'sandbox' array key
+ *     is not initially set when this callback is first called, which makes it
+ *     useful for determining whether it is the first call of the callback or
+ *     not:
+ *     @code
+ *       if (empty($context['sandbox'])) {
+ *         // Perform set-up steps here.
+ *       }
+ *     @endcode
+ *     The values in the sandbox are stored and updated in the database between
+ *     http requests until the batch finishes processing. This avoids problems
+ *     if the user navigates away from the page before the batch finishes.
+ *   - 'message': A text message displayed in the progress page.
+ *   - 'results': The array of results gathered so far by the batch processing.
+ *     This array is highly useful for passing data between operations. After
+ *     all operations have finished, this is passed to callback_batch_finished()
+ *     where results may be referenced to display information to the end-user,

+Installation profiles define additional steps that run after the base
+installation provided by Drupal core when Drupal is first installed.
+
+WHAT TO PLACE IN THIS DIRECTORY?
+--------------------------------
+
+Place downloaded and custom installation profiles in this directory.
+Installation profiles are generally provided as part of a Drupal distribution.
+They only impact the installation of your site. They do not have any effect on
+an already running site.
+
+DOWNLOAD ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS
+---------------------------------
+
+Contributed distributions from the Drupal community may be downloaded at
+https://www.drupal.org/project/project_distribution.
+
+MULTISITE CONFIGURATION
+-----------------------
+
+In multisite configurations, installation profiles found in this directory are
+available to all sites during their initial site installation.
+
+MORE INFORMATION
+----------------
+
+Refer to the "Installation profiles" section of the README.txt in the Drupal
+root directory for further information on extending Drupal with custom profiles.
