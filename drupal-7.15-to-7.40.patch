+Drupal 7.40, 2015-10-14
+-----------------------
+- Made Drupal's code for parsing .info files run much faster and use much less
+  memory.
+- Prevented drupal_http_request() from returning an error when it receives a
+  201 through 206 HTTP status code.
+- Added support for autoloading traits via the registry on sites running PHP
+  5.4 or higher.
+- Allowed the user-picture.tpl.php theme template to have HTML classes besides
+  the default "user-picture" class printed in it (markup change).
+- Fixed the URL text filter to convert e-mail addresses with plus signs into
+  mailto: links.
+- Added alternate text to file icons displayed by the File module, to improve
+  accessibility (string change, and minor API addition to theme_file_icon()).
+- Changed one-time login link failure messages to be displayed as errors or
+  warnings as appropriate, rather than as regular status messages (minor UI
+  change and data structure change).
+- Changed the default settings.php configuration to exclude private files from
+  the "404_fast_paths" behavior.
+- Changed the page that displays filter tips for a particular text format, for
+  example filter/tips/full_html, to return "page not found" or "access denied"
+  if the format does not exist or the user does not have access to it. This
+  change adds a new menu item to the Filter module's hook_menu() entry (minor
+  data structure change).
+- Added a new hook, hook_block_cid_parts_alter(), to allow modules to alter the
+  cache keys used for caching a particular block.
+- Made drupal_set_message() display and return messages when "0" is passed in
+  as the message to set.
+- Fixed non-functional "Files displayed by default" setting on file fields.
+- The "worker callback" provided in hook_cron_queue_info() and the "finished"
+  callback specified during batch processing can now be any PHP callable
+  instead of just functions.
+- Prevented drupal_set_time_limit() from decreasing the time limit in the case
+  where the PHP maximum execution time is already unlimited.
+- Changed the default thousand marker for numeric fields from a space ("1 000")
+  to nothing ("1000") (minor UI change: https://www.drupal.org/node/1388376).
+- Prevented malformed theme .info files (without a "name" key) from causing
+  exceptions during menu rebuilds. If an .info file without a "name" key is
+  found in a module or theme directory, Drupal will now use the module or
+  theme's machine name as the display name instead.
+- Made the format column in the {date_format_locale} database table
+  case-sensitive, to match the equivalent column in the {date_formats} table.
+- Fixed a bug in the Statistics module that caused JavaScript files attached to
+  a node while it is being viewed to be omitted from the page.
+- Added an optional 'project:' prefix that can be added to dependencies in a
+  module's .info file to indicate which project the dependency resides in (API
+  addition: https://www.drupal.org/node/2299747).
+- Fixed various bugs that occurred after hooks were invoked early in the Drupal
+  bootstrap and that caused module_implements() and drupal_alter() to cache an
+  incomplete set of hook implementations for later use.
+- Set the X-Content-Type-Options header to "nosniff" when possible, to prevent
+  certain web browsers from picking an unsafe MIME type.
+- Prevented the database API from executing multiple queries at once on MySQL,
+  if the site's PHP version is new enough to do so. This is a secondary defense
+  against SQL injection (API change: https://www.drupal.org/node/2463973).
+- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused the upgrade
+  to fail when there were multiple file records pointing to the same file.
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.39, 2015-08-19
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2015-003.
+
+Drupal 7.38, 2015-06-17
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2015-002.
+
+Drupal 7.37, 2015-05-07
+-----------------------
+- Fixed a regression in Drupal 7.36 which caused certain kinds of content types
+  to become disabled if they were defined by a no-longer-enabled module.
+- Removed a confusing description regarding automatic time zone detection from
+  the user account form (minor UI and data structure change).
+- Allowed custom HTML tags with a dash in the name to pass through filter_xss()
+  when specified in the list of allowed tags.
+- Allowed hook_field_schema() implementations to specify indexes for fields
+  based on a fixed-length column prefix (rather than the entire column), as was
+  already allowed in hook_schema() implementations.
+- Fixed PDO exceptions on PostgreSQL when accessing invalid entity URLs.
+- Added a sites/all/libraries folder to the codebase, with instructions for
+  using it.
+- Added a description to the "Administer text formats and filters" permission
+  on the Permissions page (string change).
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.36, 2015-04-01
+-----------------------
+- Added a 'file_public_schema' variable which allows modules that define
+  publicly-accessible streams in hook_stream_wrappers() to bypass file download
+  access checks when processing managed file upload fields.
+- Fixed a bug that caused database query tags not to be added to search-related
+  database queries under many circumstances, and which prevented the
+  corresponding hook_query_TAG_alter() implementations from being called.
+- Fixed the "for" attribute on managed file upload field labels to improve
+  accessibility (minor markup change).
+- Added a 'javascript_always_use_jquery' variable which can be set to FALSE by
+  sites that may not need jQuery loaded on all pages, and a 'requires_jquery'
+  option to drupal_add_js() which modules can set to FALSE when adding
+  JavaScript files that have no dependency on jQuery (API addition:
+  https://www.drupal.org/node/2462717).
+- Fixed incorrect foreign keys in the User module's role_permission and
+  users_roles database tables.
+- Changed permission descriptions throughout Drupal core to consistently link
+  to relevant administrative pages, regardless of whether the user viewing the
+  Permissions page can view the page being linked to (minor UI change).
+- Fixed the drupal_add_region_content() function so that it actually adds
+  content to the page.
+- Added an 'image_suppress_itok_output' variable to allow sites already using
+  the existing 'image_allow_insecure_derivatives' variable to also prevent
+  security tokens from appearing in image derivative URLs.
+- Fixed double-escaping of theme names in the Block module administrative
+  interface (minor string change).
+- Added basic support for Xdebug when running automated tests.
+- Fixed a bug which caused previewing a node to remove elements from the node
+  being edited. With this fix, calling node_preview() will no longer modify the
+  passed-in node object (minor API change).
+- Added a user_has_role() function to check whether a user has a particular
+  role (API addition: https://www.drupal.org/node/2462411).
+- Fixed installation failures when an opcode cache is enabled.
+- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused private
+  files to be inaccessible.
+- Fixed a bug in the Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrade path which caused user
+  pictures to be lost.
+- Fixed missing language code in hook_field_attach_view_alter() when it is
+  invoked from field_view_field().
+- Stopped sending ETag and Last-Modified headers for uncached page requests,
+  since they break caching for certain Varnish and Nginx configurations.
+- Changed the Simpletest module to allow PSR-4 test classes to be used in
+  Drupal 7.
+- Fixed a fatal error that occurred when using the Comment module's "Unpublish
+  comment containing keyword(s)" action.
+- Changed the "lang" attribute on language links to "xml:lang" so it validates
+  as XHTML (minor markup change).
+- Prevented the form API from allowing arrays to be submitted for various form
+  elements, such as textfields, textareas, and password fields (API change:
+  https://www.drupal.org/node/2462723).
+- Fixed a bug in the Contact module which caused the global user object to have
+  the incorrect name and e-mail address during the remainder of the page
+  request after the contact form is submitted.
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.35, 2015-03-18
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2015-001.
+
+Drupal 7.34, 2014-11-19
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2014-006.
+
+Drupal 7.33, 2014-11-07
+-----------------------
+- Began storing the file modification time of each module and theme in the
+  {system} database table so that contributed modules can use it to identify
+  recently changed modules and themes (minor data structure change to the
+  return value of system_get_info() and other related functions).
+- Added a "Did you mean?" feature to the run-tests.sh script for running
+  automated tests from the command line, to help developers who are attempting
+  to run a particular test class or group.
+- Changed the date format used in various HTTP headers output by Drupal core
+  from RFC 1123 format to RFC 7231 format.
+- Added a "block_cache_bypass_node_grants" variable to allow sites which have
+  node access modules enabled to use the block cache if desired (API addition).
+- Made image derivative generation HTTP requests return a 404 error (rather
+  than a 500 error) when the source image does not exist.
+- Fixed a bug which caused user pictures to be removed from the user object
+  after saving, and resulted in data loss if the user account was subsequently
+  re-saved.
+- Fixed a bug in which field_has_data() did not return TRUE for fields that
+  only had data in older entity revisions, leading to loss of the field's data
+  when the field configuration was edited.
+- Fixed a bug which caused the Ajax progress throbber to appear misaligned in
+  many situatons (minor styling change).
+- Prevented the Bartik theme from lower-casing the "Permalink" link on
+  comments, for improved multilingual support (minor UI change).
+- Added a "preferred_menu_links" tag to the database query that is used by
+  menu_link_get_preferred() to find the preferred menu link for a given path,
+  to make it easier to alter.
+- Increased the maximum allowed length of block titles to 255 characters
+  (database schema change to the {block} table).
+- Removed the Field module's field_modules_uninstalled() function, since it did
+  not do anything when it was invoked.
+- Added a "theme_hook_original" variable to templates and theme functions and
+  an optional sitewide theme debug mode, to provide contextual information in
+  the page's HTML to theme developers. The theme debug mode is based on the one
+  used with Twig in Drupal 8 and can be accessed by setting the "theme_debug"
+  variable to TRUE (API addition).
+- Added an entity_view_mode_prepare() API function to allow entity-defining
+  modules to properly invoke hook_entity_view_mode_alter(), and used it
+  throughout Drupal core to fix bugs with the invocation of that hook (API
+  change: https://www.drupal.org/node/2369141).
+- Security improvement: Made the database API's orderBy() method sanitize the
+  sort direction ("ASC" or "DESC") for queries built with db_select(), so that
+  calling code does not have to.
+- Changed the RDF module to consistently output RDF metadata for nodes and
+  comments near where the node is rendered in the HTML (minor markup and data
+  structure change).
+- Added an HTML class to RDFa metatags throughout Drupal to prevent them from
+  accidentally affecting the site appearance (minor markup change).
+- Fixed a bug in the Unicode requirements check which prevented installing
+  Drupal on PHP 5.6.
+- Fixed a bug which caused drupal_get_bootstrap_phase() to abort the bootstrap
+  when called early in the page request.
+- Renamed the "Search result" view mode to "Search result highlighting input"
+  to better reflect how it is used (UI change).
+- Improved database queries generated by EntityFieldQuery in the case where
+  delta or language condition groups are used, to reduce the number of INNER
+  JOINs (this is a minor data structure change affecting code which implements
+  hook_query_alter() on these queries).
+- Removed special-case behavior for file uploads which allowed user #1 to
+  bypass maximum file size and user quota limits.
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.32, 2014-10-15
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (SQL injection). See SA-CORE-2014-005.
+
+Drupal 7.31, 2014-08-06
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (denial of service). See SA-CORE-2014-004.
+
+Drupal 7.30, 2014-07-24
+-----------------------
+- Fixed a regression introduced in Drupal 7.29 that caused files or images
+  attached to taxonomy terms to be deleted when the taxonomy term was edited
+  and resaved (and other related bugs with contributed and custom modules).
+- Added a warning on the permissions page to recommend restricting access to
+  the "View site reports" permission to trusted administrators. See
+  DRUPAL-PSA-2014-002.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.29, 2014-07-16
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2014-003.
+
+Drupal 7.28, 2014-05-08
+-----------------------
+- Fixed a regression introduced in Drupal 7.27 that caused JavaScript to break
+  on older browsers (such as Internet Explorer 8 and earlier) when Ajax was
+  used.
+- Increased the timeout used by the Update Manager module when it fetches data
+  from drupal.org (from 5 seconds to 30 seconds), to work around a problem
+  which causes incomplete information about security updates to be presented to
+  site administrators. This fix may lead to a performance slowdown on the
+  Update Manager administration pages, when installing Drupal distributions,
+  and (for sites that use the automated cron feature) on occasional page loads
+  by site visitors.
+- Fixed the behavior of the token system's "[node:summary]" token when the body
+  field does not have a manual summary.
+- Changed the behavior of db_query_temporary() so that it works on SELECT
+  queries even when they have leading comments/whitespace. A side effect of
+  this fix is that db_query_temporary() will now fail with an error if it is
+  ever used on non-SELECT queries.
+- Added a "node_admin_filter" tag to the database query used to build the list
+  of nodes on the content administration page, to make it easier to alter.
+- Made the cron queue system log any exceptions that are thrown while an item
+  in the queue is being processed, rather than stopping the entire PHP request.
+- Improved screen reader support by adding an aria-live HTML attribute to file
+  upload fields when there is an error uploading the file (minor markup
+  change).
+- Made the pager on the Tracker module listing pages show the same number of
+  items as other pagers throughout Drupal core (minor UI change).
+- Fixed a bug which caused caches not to be properly cleared when a file entity
+  was saved or deleted.
+- Added several missing countries to the default list returned by
+  country_get_list() (string change).
+- Replaced the term "weight" with "influence" in the content ranking settings
+  for search, and added help text for administrators (string change).
+- Fixed untranslatable text strings in the administrative interface for the
+  "Crop" effect provided by the Image module (minor string change).
+- Fixed a bug in the Taxonomy module update function introduced in Drupal 7.26
+  that caused memory and CPU problems on sites with very large numbers of
+  unpublished nodes.
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.27, 2014-04-16
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (information disclosure). See SA-CORE-2014-002.
+
+Drupal 7.26, 2014-01-15
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities). See SA-CORE-2014-001.
+
+Drupal 7.25, 2014-01-02
+-----------------------
+- Fixed a bug in node_save() which prevented the saved node from being updated
+  in hook_node_insert() and other similar hooks.
+- Added a meta tag to install.php to prevent it from being indexed by search
+  engines even when Drupal is installed in a subfolder (minor markup change).
+- Fixed a bug in the database API that caused frequent deadlock errors when
+  running merge queries on some servers.
+- Performance improvement: Prevented block rehashing from writing blocks to the
+  database on every cache clear and cron run when the blocks have not changed.
+  This fix results in an extra 'saved' key which is added and set to TRUE for
+  each block returned by _block_rehash() that actually is saved to the database
+  (data structure change).
+- Added an optional 'skip on cron' parameter to hook_cron_queue_info() to allow
+  queues to avoid being automatically processed on cron runs (API addition).
+- Fixed a bug which caused hook_block_view_MODULE_DELTA_alter() to never be
+  invoked if the block delta had a hyphen in it. To implement the hook when the
+  block delta has a hyphen, modules should now replace hyphens with underscores
+  when constructing the function name for the hook implementation.
+- Fixed a bug which caused cached pages to sometimes be sent to the browser
+  with incorrect compression. The fix adds a new 'page_compressed' key to the
+  $cache->data array returned by drupal_page_get_cache() (minor data structure
+  change).
+- Fixed broken tests on PHP 5.5.
+- Made the File and Image modules more robust when saving entities that have
+  deleted files attached. The code in file_field_presave() will now remove the
+  record of the deleted file from the entity before saving (minor data
+  structure change).
+- Standardized menu callback functions throughout Drupal core to return
+  MENU_NOT_FOUND and MENU_ACCESS_DENIED rather than printing their own "page
+  not found" or "access denied" pages (minor API change in the return value of
+  these functions under some circumstances).
+- Fixed a bug in which caches were not properly cleared when a node was deleted
+  via the administrative interface.
+- Changed the Bartik theme to render content contained in <pre>, <code> and
+  similar tags in a larger font size, so it is easier to read.
+- Fixed a bug in the Search module that caused exceptions to be thrown during
+  searches if the server was not configured to represent decimal points as a
+  period.
+- Fixed a regression in the Image module that made image_style_url() not work
+  when a relative path (rather than a complete file URI) was passed to it.
+- Added an optional feature to the Statistics module to allow node views to be
+  tracked by Ajax requests rather than during the server-side generation of the
+  page. This allows the node counter to work on sites that use external page
+  caches (string change and new administrative option:
+  https://drupal.org/node/2164069).
+- Added a link to the drupal.org documentation page for cron to the Cron
+  settings page (string change).
+- Added a 'drupal_anonymous_user_object' variable to allow the anonymous user
+  object returned by drupal_anonymous_user() to be overridden with a classed
+  object (API addition).
+- Changed the database API to allow inserts based on a SELECT * query to work
+  correctly.
+- Changed the database schema of the {file_managed} table to allow Drupal to
+  manage files larger than 4 GB.
+- Changed the File module's hook_field_load() implementation to prevent file
+  entity properties which have the same name as file or image field properties
+  from overwriting the field properties (minor API change).
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.24, 2013-11-20
+-----------------------
+- Fixed security issues (multiple vulnerabilities), see SA-CORE-2013-003.
+
+Drupal 7.23, 2013-08-07
+-----------------------
+- Fixed a fatal error on PostgreSQL databases when updating the Taxonomy module
+  from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7.
+- Fixed the default ordering of CSS files for sites using right-to-left
+  languages, to consistently place the right-to-left override file immediately
+  after the CSS it is overriding (API change: https://drupal.org/node/2058463).
+- Added a drupal_check_memory_limit() API function to allow the memory limit to
+  be checked consistently (API addition).
+- Changed the default web.config file for IIS servers to allow favicon.ico
+  files which are present in the filesystem to be accessed.
+- Fixed inconsistent support for the 'tel' protocol in Drupal's URL filtering
+  functions.
+- Performance improvement: Allowed all hooks to be included in the
+  module_implements() cache, even those that are only invoked on HTTP POST
+  requests.
+- Made the database system replace truncate queries with delete queries when
+  inside a transaction, to fix issues with PostgreSQL and other databases.
+- Fixed a bug which caused nested contextual links to display improperly.
+- Fixed a bug which prevented cached image derivatives from being flushed for
+  private files and other non-default file schemes.
+- Fixed drupal_render() to always return an empty string when there is no
+  output, rather than sometimes returning NULL (minor API change).
+- Added protection to cache_clear_all() to ensure that non-cache tables cannot
+  be truncated (API addition: a new isValidBin() method has been added to the
+  default database cache implementation).
+- Changed the default .htaccess file to support HTTP authorization in CGI
+  environments.
+- Changed the password reset form to pre-fill the username when requested via a
+  URL query parameter, and used this in the error message that appears after a
+  failed login attempt (minor data structure and behavior change).
+- Fixed broken support for foreign keys in the field API.
+- Fixed "No active batch" error when a user cancels their own account.
+- Added a description to the "access content overview" permission on the
+  permissions page (string change).
+- Added a drupal_array_diff_assoc_recursive() function to allow associative
+  arrays to be compared recursively (API addition).
+- Added human-readable labels to image styles, in addition to the existing
+  machine-readable name (API change: https://drupal.org/node/2058503).
+- Moved the drupal_get_hash_salt() function to bootstrap.inc and used it in
+  additional places in the code, for added security in the case where there is
+  no hash salt in settings.php.
+- Fixed a regression in Drupal 7.22 that caused internal server errors for
+  sites running on very old Apache 1.x web servers.
+- Numerous small bug fixes.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.
+
+Drupal 7.22, 2013-04-03
+-----------------------
+- Allowed the drupal_http_request() function to be overridden so that
+  additional HTTP request capabilities can be added by contributed modules.
+- Changed the Simpletest module to allow PSR-0 test classes to be used in
+  Drupal 7.
+- Removed an unnecessary "Content-Disposition" header from private file
+  downloads; it prevented many private files from being viewed inline in a web
+  browser.
+- Changed various field API functions to allow them to optionally act on a
+  single field within an entity (API addition: http://drupal.org/node/1825844).
+- Fixed a bug which prevented Drupal's file transfer functionality from working
+  on some PHP 5.4 systems.
+- Fixed incorrect log message when theme() is called for a theme hook that does
+  not exist (minor string change).
+- Fixed Drupal's token-replacement system to allow spaces in the token value.
+- Changed the default behavior after a user creates a node they do not have
+  access to view. The user will now be redirected to the front page rather than
+  an access denied page.
+- Fixed a bug which prevented empty HTTP headers (such as "0") from being set.
+  (Minor behavior change: Callers of drupal_add_http_header() must now set
+  FALSE explicitly to prevent a header from being sent at all; this was already
+  indicated in the function's documentation.)
+- Fixed OpenID errors when more than one module implements hook_openid(). The
+  behavior is now changed so that if more than one module tries to set the same
+  parameter, the last module's change takes effect.
+- Fixed a serious documentation bug: The $name variable in the
+  taxonomy-term.tpl.php theme template was incorrectly documented as being
+  sanitized when in fact it is not.
+- Fixed a bug which prevented Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrades on sites which had
+  duplicate permission names in the User module's database tables.
+- Added an empty "datatype" attribute to taxonomy term and username links to
+  make the RDFa markup upward compatible with RDFa 1.1 (minor markup addition).
+- Fixed a bug which caused the denial-of-service protection added in Drupal
+  7.20 to break certain valid image URLs that had an extra slash in them.
+- Fixed a bug with update queries in the SQLite database driver that prevented
+  Drupal from being installed with SQLite on PHP 5.4.
+- Fixed enforced dependencies errors updating to recent versions of Drupal 7 on
+  certain non-MySQL databases.
+- Refactored the Field module's caching behavior to obtain large improvements
+  in memory usage for sites with many fields and instances (API addition:
+  http://drupal.org/node/1915646).
+- Fixed entity argument not being passed to implementations of
+  hook_file_download_access_alter(). The fix adds an additional context
+  parameter that can be passed when calling drupal_alter() for any hook (API
+  change: http://drupal.org/node/1882722).
+- Fixed broken support for translatable comment fields (API change:
+  http://drupal.org/node/1874724).
+- Added an assertThemeOutput() method to Simpletest to allow tests to check
+  that themed output matches an expected HTML string (API addition).
+- Added a link to "Install another module" after a module has been successfully
+  downloaded via the Update Manager (UI change).
+- Added an optional "exclusive" flag to installation profile .info files which
+  allows Drupal distributions to force a profile to be selected during
+  installation (API addition: http://drupal.org/node/1961012).
+- Fixed a bug which caused the database API to not properly close database
+  connections.
+- Added a link to the URL for running cron from outside the site to the Cron
+  settings page (UI change).
+- Fixed a bug which prevented image styles from being reverted on PHP 5.4.
+- Made the default .htaccess rules protocol sensitive to improve security for
+  sites which use HTTPS and redirect between "www" and non-"www" versions of
+  the page.

+Drupal 7.17, 2012-11-07
+-----------------------
+- Changed the default value of the '404_fast_html' variable to have a DOCTYPE
+  declaration.
+- Made it possible to use associative arrays for the 'items' variable in
+  theme_item_list().
+- Fixed a bug which prevented required form elements without a title from being
+  given an "error" class when the form fails validation.
+- Prevented duplicate HTML IDs from appearing when two forms are displayed on
+  the same page and one of them is submitted with invalid data (minor markup
+  change).
+- Fixed a bug which prevented Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 upgrades on sites which had
+  stale data in the Upload module's database tables.
+- Fixed a bug in the States API which prevented certain types of form elements
+  from being disabled when requested.
+- Allowed aggregator feed items with author names longer than 255 characters to
+  have a truncated version saved to the database (rather than causing a fatal
+  error).
+- Allowed aggregator feed items to have URLs longer than 255 characters
+  (schema change which results in several columns in the Aggregator module's
+  database tables changing from VARCHAR to TEXT fields).
+- Added hook_taxonomy_term_view() and standardized the process for rendering
+  taxonomy terms to invoke hook_entity_view() and otherwise make it consistent
+  with other entities (API change: http://drupal.org/node/1808870).
+- Added hook_entity_view_mode_alter() to allow modules to change entity view
+  modes on display (API addition: http://drupal.org/node/1833086).
+- Fixed a bug which made database queries running a "LIKE" query on blob fields
+  fail on PostgreSQL databases. This caused errors during the Drupal 6 to
+  Drupal 7 upgrade.
+- Changed the hook_menu() entry for Drupal's rss.xml page to prevent extra path
+  components from being accidentally passed to the page callback function (data
+  structure change).
+- Removed a non-standard "name" attribute from Drupal's default Content-Type
+  header for file downloads.
+- Fixed the theme settings form to properly clean up submitted values in
+  $form_state['values'] when the form is submitted (data structure change).
+- Fixed an inconsistency by removing the colon from the end of the label on
+  multi-valued form fields (minor string change).
+- Added support for 'weight' in hook_field_widget_info() to allow modules to
+  control the order in which widgets are displayed in the Field UI.
+- Updated various tables in the OpenID and Book modules to use the default
+  "empty table" text pattern (string change).
+- Added proxy server support to drupal_http_request().
+- Added "lang" attributes to language links, to better support screen readers.
+- Fixed double occurrence of a "ul" HTML tag on secondary local tasks in the
+  Seven theme (markup change).
+- Fixed bugs which caused taxonomy vocabulary and shortcut set titles to be
+  double-escaped. The fix replaces the taxonomy vocabulary overview page and
+  "Edit shortcuts" menu items' title callback entries in hook_menu() with new
+  functions that do not escape HTML characters (data structure change).
+- Modified the Update manager module to allow drupal.org to collect usage
+  statistics for individual modules and themes, rather than only for entire
+  projects.
+- Modified the node listing database query on Drupal's default front page to
+  add table aliases for better query altering (this is a data structure change
+  affecting code which implements hook_query_alter() on this query).
+- Improved the translatability of the "Field type(s) in use" message on the
+  modules page (admin-facing string change).
+- Fixed a regression which caused a "call to undefined function
+  drupal_find_base_themes()" fatal error under rare circumstances.
+- Numerous API documentation improvements.
+- Additional automated test coverage.

+INSTALLATION PROFILES
+---------------------
+
+Installation profiles define additional steps (such as enabling modules,
+defining content types, etc.) that run after the base installation provided
+by core when Drupal is first installed. There are two basic installation
+profiles provided with Drupal core.
+
+Installation profiles from the Drupal community modify the installation process
+to provide a website for a specific use case, such as a CMS for media
+publishers, a web-based project tracking tool, or a full-fledged CRM for
+non-profit organizations raising money and accepting donations. They can be
+distributed as bare installation profiles or as "distributions". Distributions
+include Drupal core, the installation profile, and all other required
+extensions, such as contributed and custom modules, themes, and third-party
+libraries. Bare installation profiles require you to download Drupal Core and
+the required extensions separately; place the downloaded profile in the
+/profiles directory before you start the installation process. Note that the
+contents of this directory may be overwritten during updates of Drupal core;
+it is advised to keep code backups or use a version control system.
+
+Additionally, modules and themes may be placed inside subdirectories in a
+specific installation profile such as profiles/your_site_profile/modules and
+profiles/your_site_profile/themes respectively to restrict their usage to only
+sites that were installed with that specific profile.
+
+More about installation profiles and distributions:
+ * Read about the difference between installation profiles and distributions:

 /**
  * Redirects the user to a URL after a form has been processed.
  *
- * After a form was executed, the data in $form_state controls whether the form
- * is redirected. By default, we redirect to a new destination page. The path
- * of the destination page can be set in $form_state['redirect'], as either a
- * string containing the destination or an array of arguments compatible with
- * drupal_goto(). If that is not set, the user is redirected to the current
- * page to display a fresh, unpopulated copy of the form.
+ * After a form is submitted and processed, normally the user should be
+ * redirected to a new destination page. This function figures out what that
+ * destination should be, based on the $form_state array and the 'destination'
+ * query string in the request URL, and redirects the user there.
+ *
+ * Usually (for exceptions, see below) $form_state['redirect'] determines where
+ * to redirect the user. This can be set either to a string (the path to
+ * redirect to), or an array of arguments for drupal_goto(). If
+ * $form_state['redirect'] is missing, the user is usually (again, see below for
+ * exceptions) redirected back to the page they came from, where they should see
+ * a fresh, unpopulated copy of the form.
  *
- * For example, to redirect to 'node':
+ * Here is an example of how to set up a form to redirect to the path 'node':

  *
- * There are several triggers that may prevent a redirection though:
- * - If $form_state['redirect'] is FALSE, a form builder function or form
- *   validation/submit handler does not want a user to be redirected, which
- *   means that drupal_goto() is not invoked. For most forms, the redirection
- *   logic will be the same regardless of whether $form_state['redirect'] is
- *   undefined or FALSE. However, in case it was not defined and the current
- *   request contains a 'destination' query string, drupal_goto() will redirect
- *   to that given destination instead. Only setting $form_state['redirect'] to
- *   FALSE will prevent any redirection.
- * - If $form_state['no_redirect'] is TRUE, then the callback that originally
- *   built the form explicitly disallows any redirection, regardless of the
- *   redirection value in $form_state['redirect']. For example, ajax_get_form()
- *   defines $form_state['no_redirect'] when building a form in an Ajax
- *   callback to prevent any redirection. $form_state['no_redirect'] should NOT
- *   be altered by form builder functions or form validation/submit handlers.
+ * There are several exceptions to the "usual" behavior described above:
  * - If $form_state['programmed'] is TRUE, the form submission was usually
  *   invoked via drupal_form_submit(), so any redirection would break the script
- *   that invoked drupal_form_submit().
- * - If $form_state['rebuild'] is TRUE, the form needs to be rebuilt without
- *   redirection.
+ *   that invoked drupal_form_submit() and no redirection is done.
+ * - If $form_state['rebuild'] is TRUE, the form is being rebuilt, and no
+ *   redirection is done.
+ * - If $form_state['no_redirect'] is TRUE, redirection is disabled. This is
+ *   set, for instance, by ajax_get_form() to prevent redirection in Ajax
+ *   callbacks. $form_state['no_redirect'] should never be set or altered by
+ *   form builder functions or form validation/submit handlers.
+ * - If $form_state['redirect'] is set to FALSE, redirection is disabled.
+ * - If none of the above conditions has prevented redirection, then the
+ *   redirect is accomplished by calling drupal_goto(), passing in the value of
+ *   $form_state['redirect'] if it is set, or the current path if it is
+ *   not. drupal_goto() preferentially uses the value of $_GET['destination']
+ *   (the 'destination' URL query string) if it is present, so this will

 /**
- * Return all the defined language types.
+ * @defgroup language_negotiation Language Negotiation API functionality
+ * @{
+ * Functions to customize the language types and the negotiation process.
+ *
+ * The language negotiation API is based on two major concepts:
+ * - Language types: types of translatable data (the types of data that a user
+ *   can view or request).
+ * - Language negotiation providers: functions for determining which language to
+ *   use to present a particular piece of data to the user.
+ * Both language types and language negotiation providers are customizable.
+ *
+ * Drupal defines three built-in language types:
+ * - Interface language: The page's main language, used to present translated
+ *   user interface elements such as titles, labels, help text, and messages.
+ * - Content language: The language used to present content that is available
+ *   in more than one language (see
+ *   @link field_language Field Language API @endlink for details).
+ * - URL language: The language associated with URLs. When generating a URL,
+ *   this value will be used by url() as a default if no explicit preference is
+ *   provided.
+ * Modules can define additional language types through
+ * hook_language_types_info(), and alter existing language type definitions
+ * through hook_language_types_info_alter().
+ *
+ * Language types may be configurable or fixed. The language negotiation
+ * providers associated with a configurable language type can be explicitly
+ * set through the user interface. A fixed language type has predetermined
+ * (module-defined) language negotiation settings and, thus, does not appear in
+ * the configuration page. Here is a code snippet that makes the content
+ * language (which by default inherits the interface language's values)
+ * configurable:
+ * @code
+ * function mymodule_language_types_info_alter(&$language_types) {
+ *   unset($language_types[LANGUAGE_TYPE_CONTENT]['fixed']);
+ * }
+ * @endcode
+ *
+ * Every language type can have a different set of language negotiation
+ * providers assigned to it. Different language types often share the same
+ * language negotiation settings, but they can have independent settings if
+ * needed. If two language types are configured the same way, their language
+ * switcher configuration will be functionally identical and the same settings
+ * will act on both language types.
+ *
+ * Drupal defines the following built-in language negotiation providers:
+ * - URL: Determine the language from the URL (path prefix or domain).
+ * - Session: Determine the language from a request/session parameter.
+ * - User: Follow the user's language preference.
+ * - Browser: Determine the language from the browser's language settings.
+ * - Default language: Use the default site language.
+ * Language negotiation providers are simple callback functions that implement a
+ * particular logic to return a language code. For instance, the URL provider
+ * searches for a valid path prefix or domain name in the current request URL.
+ * If a language negotiation provider does not return a valid language code, the
+ * next provider associated to the language type (based on provider weight) is
+ * invoked.
+ *
+ * Modules can define additional language negotiation providers through
+ * hook_language_negotiation_info(), and alter existing providers through
+ * hook_language_negotiation_info_alter(). Here is an example snippet that lets
+ * path prefixes be ignored for administrative paths:
+ * @code
+ * function mymodule_language_negotiation_info_alter(&$negotiation_info) {
+ *   // Replace the core function with our own function.
+ *   module_load_include('language', 'inc', 'language.negotiation');
+ *   $negotiation_info[LANGUAGE_NEGOTIATION_URL]['callbacks']['language'] = 'mymodule_from_url';
+ *   $negotiation_info[LANGUAGE_NEGOTIATION_URL]['file'] = drupal_get_path('module', 'mymodule') . '/mymodule.module';
+ * }
+ *
+ * function mymodule_from_url($languages) {
+ *   // Use the core URL language negotiation provider to get a valid language
+ *   // code.
+ *   module_load_include('language', 'inc', 'language.negotiation');
+ *   $langcode = language_from_url($languages);
+ *
+ *   // If we are on an administrative path, override with the default language.
+ *   if (isset($_GET['q']) && strtok($_GET['q'], '/') == 'admin') {

-/**
- * Provide online user help.
- *
- * By implementing hook_help(), a module can make documentation available to
- * the user for the module as a whole, or for specific paths.  Help for
- * developers should usually be provided via function header comments in the
- * code, or in special API example files.
- *
- * For a detailed usage example, see page_example.module.
- *
- * @param $path
- *   The router menu path, as defined in hook_menu(), for the help that is
- *   being requested; e.g., 'admin/people' or 'user/register'.  If the router
- *   path includes a wildcard, then this will appear in $path as %, even if it
- *   is a named %autoloader wildcard in the hook_menu() implementation; for
- *   example, node pages would have $path equal to 'node/%' or 'node/%/view'.
- *   To provide a help page for a whole module with a listing on admin/help,
- *   your hook implementation should match a path with a special descriptor
- *   after a "#" sign:
- *     'admin/help#modulename'
- *       The main module help text, displayed on the admin/help/modulename
- *       page and linked to from the admin/help page.
- * @param $arg
- *   An array that corresponds to the return value of the arg() function, for
- *   modules that want to provide help that is specific to certain values
- *   of wildcards in $path. For example, you could provide help for the path
- *   'user/1' by looking for the path 'user/%' and $arg[1] == '1'. This given
- *   array should always be used rather than directly invoking arg(), because
- *   your hook implementation may be called for other purposes besides building
- *   the current page's help. Note that depending on which module is invoking
- *   hook_help, $arg may contain only empty strings. Regardless, $arg[0] to
- *   $arg[11] will always be set.
- *
- * @return
- *   A localized string containing the help text.

- *   function prefix.  For example, poll.module defines the base for the Poll
- *   content type as "poll", so during creation of a poll node, hook_insert() is
- *   only invoked by calling poll_insert().
- * - All-module hooks: This set of hooks is invoked on all implementing
- *   modules, to allow other modules to modify what the primary node module is
- *   doing. For example, hook_node_insert() is invoked on all modules when
- *   creating a poll node.
+ * - Node-type-specific hooks: When defining a node type, hook_node_info()

+ *   base_hookname() instead of mymodule_hookname() (in a module called
+ *   'mymodule' for example). Only the node type's corresponding implementation
+ *   is invoked. For example, poll_node_info() in poll.module defines the base
+ *   for the 'poll' node type as 'poll'. So when a poll node is created,
+ *   hook_insert() is invoked on poll_insert() only.

+ *   Additional parameters specific to the batch. These are specified in the
+ *   array passed to batch_set().
+ * @param $context
+ *   The batch context array, passed by reference. This contains the following
+ *   properties:
+ *   - 'finished': A float number between 0 and 1 informing the processing
+ *     engine of the completion level for the operation. 1 (or no value
+ *     explicitly set) means the operation is finished: the operation will not
+ *     be called again, and execution passes to the next operation or the
+ *     callback_batch_finished() implementation. Any other value causes this
+ *     operation to be called again; however it should be noted that the value
+ *     set here does not persist between executions of this callback: each time
+ *     it is set to 1 by default by the batch system.
+ *   - 'sandbox': This may be used by operations to persist data between
+ *     successive calls to the current operation. Any values set in
+ *     $context['sandbox'] will be there the next time this function is called
+ *     for the current operation. For example, an operation may wish to store a
+ *     pointer in a file or an offset for a large query. The 'sandbox' array key
+ *     is not initially set when this callback is first called, which makes it
+ *     useful for determining whether it is the first call of the callback or
+ *     not:
+ *     @code
+ *       if (empty($context['sandbox'])) {
+ *         // Perform set-up steps here.
+ *       }
+ *     @endcode
+ *     The values in the sandbox are stored and updated in the database between
+ *     http requests until the batch finishes processing. This avoids problems
+ *     if the user navigates away from the page before the batch finishes.
+ *   - 'message': A text message displayed in the progress page.
+ *   - 'results': The array of results gathered so far by the batch processing.
+ *     This array is highly useful for passing data between operations. After
+ *     all operations have finished, this is passed to callback_batch_finished()
+ *     where results may be referenced to display information to the end-user,
+ *     such as how many total items were processed.

+ * @defgroup update_api Update versions of API functions
+ * @{
+ * Functions that are similar to normal API functions, but do not invoke hooks.
+ *
+ * These simplified versions of core API functions are provided for use by
+ * update functions (hook_update_N() implementations).
+ *
+ * During database updates the schema of any module could be out of date. For
+ * this reason, caution is needed when using any API function within an update
+ * function - particularly CRUD functions, functions that depend on the schema
+ * (for example by using drupal_write_record()), and any functions that invoke
+ * hooks.
+ *
+ * Instead, a simplified utility function should be used. If a utility version
+ * of the API function you require does not already exist, then you should
+ * create a new function. The new utility function should be named
+ * _update_N_mymodule_my_function(). N is the schema version the function acts
+ * on (the schema version is the number N from the hook_update_N()
+ * implementation where this schema was introduced, or a number following the
+ * same numbering scheme), and mymodule_my_function is the name of the original
+ * API function including the module's name.
+ *
+ * Examples:
+ * - _update_6000_mymodule_save(): This function performs a save operation
+ *   without invoking any hooks using the 6.x schema.
+ * - _update_7000_mymodule_save(): This function performs the same save
+ *   operation using the 7.x schema.
+ *
+ * The utility function should not invoke any hooks, and should perform database
+ * operations using functions from the
+ * @link database Database abstraction layer, @endlink
+ * like db_insert(), db_update(), db_delete(), db_query(), and so on.
+ *
+ * If a change to the schema necessitates a change to the utility function, a
+ * new function should be created with a name based on the version of the schema
+ * it acts on. See _update_7000_bar_get_types() and _update_7001_bar_get_types()
+ * in the code examples that follow.
+ *
+ * For example, foo.install could contain:
+ * @code
+ * function foo_update_dependencies() {
+ *   // foo_update_7010() needs to run after bar_update_7000().
+ *   $dependencies['foo'][7010] = array(
+ *     'bar' => 7000,
+ *   );
+ *
+ *   // foo_update_7036() needs to run after bar_update_7001().
+ *   $dependencies['foo'][7036] = array(
+ *     'bar' => 7001,
+ *   );
+ *
+ *   return $dependencies;
+ * }
+ *
+ * function foo_update_7000() {
+ *   // No updates have been run on the {bar_types} table yet, so this needs
+ *   // to work with the 6.x schema.
+ *   foreach (_update_6000_bar_get_types() as $type) {
+ *     // Rename a variable.
+ *   }
+ * }
+ *
+ * function foo_update_7010() {
+ *    // Since foo_update_7010() is going to run after bar_update_7000(), it
+ *    // needs to operate on the new schema, not the old one.
+ *    foreach (_update_7000_bar_get_types() as $type) {
+ *      // Rename a different variable.
+ *    }
+ * }
+ *
+ * function foo_update_7036() {
+ *   // This update will run after bar_update_7001().
+ *   foreach (_update_7001_bar_get_types() as $type) {
+ *   }
+ * }
+ * @endcode
+ *
+ * And bar.install could contain:
+ * @code
+ * function bar_update_7000() {
+ *   // Type and bundle are confusing, so we renamed the table.
+ *   db_rename_table('bar_types', 'bar_bundles');
+ * }
+ *
+ * function bar_update_7001() {
+ *   // Database table names should be singular when possible.
+ *   db_rename_table('bar_bundles', 'bar_bundle');
+ * }
+ *
+ * function _update_6000_bar_get_types() {
+ *   db_query('SELECT * FROM {bar_types}')->fetchAll();

+ * function _update_7000_bar_get_types() {

+Installation profiles define additional steps that run after the base
+installation provided by Drupal core when Drupal is first installed.
+
+WHAT TO PLACE IN THIS DIRECTORY?
+--------------------------------
+
+Place downloaded and custom installation profiles in this directory.
+Installation profiles are generally provided as part of a Drupal distribution.
+They only impact the installation of your site. They do not have any effect on
+an already running site.
+
+DOWNLOAD ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTIONS
+---------------------------------
+
+Contributed distributions from the Drupal community may be downloaded at
+https://www.drupal.org/project/project_distribution.
+
+MULTISITE CONFIGURATION
+-----------------------
+
+In multisite configurations, installation profiles found in this directory are
+available to all sites during their initial site installation.
+
+MORE INFORMATION
+----------------
+
+Refer to the "Installation profiles" section of the README.txt in the Drupal
+root directory for further information on extending Drupal with custom profiles.

+WHAT TO PLACE IN THIS DIRECTORY?
+--------------------------------
+
+Placing downloaded and custom modules in this directory separates downloaded and
+custom modules from Drupal core's modules. This allows Drupal core to be updated

+
+ORGANIZING MODULES IN THIS DIRECTORY
+------------------------------------
+
+You may create subdirectories in this directory, to organize your added modules,
+without breaking the site. Some common subdirectories include "contrib" for
+contributed modules, and "custom" for custom modules. Note that if you move a
+module to a subdirectory after it has been enabled, you may need to clear the
+Drupal cache so it can be found. (Alternatively, you can disable the module
+before moving it and then re-enable it after the move.)
+
+MULTISITE CONFIGURATION
+-----------------------
+
+In multisite configurations, modules found in this directory are available to
+all sites. Alternatively, the sites/your_site_name/modules directory pattern
+may be used to restrict modules to a specific site instance.

- * Drupal searches for an appropriate configuration directory based on the
- * website's hostname and pathname. A detailed description of the rules for
- * discovering the configuration directory can be found in the comment
- * documentation in 'sites/default/default.settings.php'.
- *
- * This file allows you to define a set of aliases that map hostnames and
- * pathnames to configuration directories. These aliases are loaded prior to
- * scanning for directories, and they are exempt from the normal discovery
- * rules. The aliases are defined in an associative array named $sites, which
- * should look similar to the following:
- *
- * $sites = array(
- *   'devexample.com' => 'example.com',
- *   'localhost.example' => 'example.com',
- * );
- *
- * The above array will cause Drupal to look for a directory named
- * "example.com" in the sites directory whenever a request comes from
- * "example.com", "devexample.com", or "localhost/example". That is useful
- * on development servers, where the domain name may not be the same as the
- * domain of the live server. Since Drupal stores file paths into the database
- * (files, system table, etc.) this will ensure the paths are correct while
- * accessed on development servers.

  *
  * To use this file, copy and rename it such that its path plus filename is
